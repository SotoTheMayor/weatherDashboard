# <Weather_Dashboard>

## Description

This site was created to be able to search current weather and weather forecasts for any city.  It works on international locations, as well.  A search history is saved in local storage and arranged on the page as buttons you can click to check the weather at the last 5 locations you've searched.  This functionality can help if you frequently travel somewhere, have a loved one in a certain city, etc.

In the process of making this site, I learned a tremendous amount about server API calls.  Through frequent use, I also feel much more comfortable with passing variables between functions, and utilizing button clicks.  I had to mingle a static and a server API, which taught me a lot, as well.

## Installation

No installation or special actions needed.  Visit the site and start searching!

## Usage

Weather API can be a little picky.  Sometimes, if you click the buttons too many times quickly, it can have unintended results with the searches or history.  You almost have to try to get it to happen, and the fix is easily implemented by reloading the page.
